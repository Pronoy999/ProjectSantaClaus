# ProjectSantaClaus
This is the project to share media between 2 devices with watermarking and compression.

This project uploads the image to AWS S3 bucket and then shares the link with the receipent. 

An Android app to send media files securely over the internet using less amount of data. Unlike Whatsapp it doesn't stop the user from sending over 10 MB files. Once the file is send it creates a watermark on the file without losing any data and that file can be claimed later for the ownership. The files can only be shared with the person the owner wants to, the shared person can't forward it without the owner permission.
